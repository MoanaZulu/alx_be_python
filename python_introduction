## Basic_operations.py

# Define the two numbers
number1 = 10
number2 = 5

# Perform arithmetic operations
sum_result = number1 + number2
difference_result = number1 - number2
product_result = number1 * number2

# Print the results in the specified format
print(f"Addition of {number1} and {number2} is {sum_result}")
print(f"Subtraction of {number1} and {number2} is {difference_result}")
print(f"Multiplication of {number1} and {number2} is {product_result}")

## Simple_interest.py

# Define the investment details
principal = 1000      # Initial investment amount in dollars
rate = 0.05           # Annual interest rate (5%)
time = 3              # Investment duration in years

# Calculate simple interest
interest = principal * rate * time

# Print the result in the specified format
print(f"The simple interest is: {interest}")


## Rectangle_area.py

# Define the dimensions of the rectangle
length = 10
width = 5

# Calculate the area
area = length * width

# Print the result in the specified format
print(f"The area of the rectangle is: {area}")

## Hours_to_seconds.py

# Define the number of hours
hours = 2

# Convert hours to seconds (1 hour = 3600 seconds)
seconds = hours * 3600

# Print the result in the specified format
print(f"{hours} hour(s) is {seconds} seconds")


## Future_age_calculator.py

# Prompt the user for their current age
current_age = int(input("How old are you? "))

# Calculate age in 2050 (assuming current year is 2023)
age_in_2050 = current_age + 27

# Print the result in the specified format
print(f"In 2050, you will be {age_in_2050} years old.")
